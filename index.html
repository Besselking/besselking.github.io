    <h1>This html page is styled like a latex source file.</h1>
    <p>This “project” is inspired by <a href="https://secretgeek.github.io/html_wysiwyg/html.html">html wysiwyg</a>. 
    All latex commands are added with psuedo elements (::before, :after) and do not exist in the html source file. Mixed with a little bit of normal styling to make it a bit more pleasant to look at.
    </p>
    <h2>Elements that kinda work</h2>
    <h4>h4</h4>
    <h5>h5</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Unordered lists</li>
        <li>item2</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Ordered lists</li>
        <li>Loses its numbering</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <b>bold text</b> normal text <strong>strong text</strong> <em>emphasized text</em> <i>italized text</i>
        <u>underscore</u> <s>strikethrough</s>
    </p>
    <p>Psuedo elements's text-decoration can't be turned off, strangely bold and strong aren't affected by its own style.</p>

    <blockquote>
        Block quotes
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Horizontal rules, based on pandocs translation.
        <hr>
    </p>

    inline <q>quotes</q>
    <p>
        <mark>Marked text</mark> <dfn>definition</dfn> are both based on the pandoc translation, doesn't seem to do
        anything in latex though
    </p>

    <p>Sub<sub>script</sub> H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>
        Super<sup>script</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Elements that dont work</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>replacement elements like img, or br</li>
        <li>tables, a tables header is rendered before the table::before, which makes it impossible (too annoying) to
            translate it to latex with psuedo classes. Also tables in Latex are super ugly and unreadable in the source
            file</li>
        <li>h6, there is no subsubparagraph in the default article class</li>
        <li>Probably a lot more doesn't quite work right</li>
    </ul>
